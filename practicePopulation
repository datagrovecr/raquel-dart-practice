--In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. 
--The population regularly increases by 2 percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. 
--How many years does the town need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?


int nbYear(num p0, double percent, int aug, int p) {
  int i=0;
  do{
    p0 = p0 + p0*(percent/100)+aug;
    i++;
  }while(p0 < p);
  return (i);
}
